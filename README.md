# Word-Guess-Game
Game based on hangman.

## Known issues
When I first read the assignment I saw the part about "getting creative and having fun with it" and then I watched the video and went of to work on it. Now after going over it again, I see we were supposed to use the space bar for game play. 

I could have controlled everything by one keyup event. #$*&% !!

### Item to work on

Reading
```
Need to read all the way through first, then plan.
```
Flexibility
```
Plan better, make the code more flexible so it can adapt when needed.
```
