# Word-Guess-Game
Game based on hangman.

## Known issues
Yeah, mostly inadequacies with functions, some I'm comfy with, other I threw against the wall to see if they'd stick. Lucky most of them stuck.
The keyup function has a hard time with fast typers, it crashed on the word 'yellow' when the person knew the word and all that was left was the two ll's, so the went real fast and for some reason it just got stuck. Typing slow worked. Go figure. Don't know if it's my code or the function itself.

### Item to work on

Timers
```
Timer shold be reuseable. Need to make it so I can pass in an item and a time.
```
Condensing
```
Had it all working at 68 lines of code, then it went bulk adding functionality.
There is a better way, just don't know it yet.
